I have been a Los Angeles native for about 5 years now, everytime a loved one visits it is obligatory for me to show them around. This whole project came in to existence because earlier this year a friend of mine was visiting Los Angeles and they asked for some help in finding a reasonable AirBnB accomodation. I started looking up AirBnB Listings and the variance in the pricing was very fascinating. After helping them find a really sweet spot in West LA I though about doing a deep dive in to the AirBnB Listings & Market specifically in Los Angeles. From coastal mansions to cozy East-Side bungalows, nightly prices in L.A. differ six-fold. As I kept digging in to the data and looking at trends I realized that the rental regulations in 2016-17 and COVID-19 had great effect on the AirBnB Market in Los Angeles.
